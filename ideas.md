integrate elite dangerous and hackmud together
#why:
    ed and hackmud both provide enough content to be played alone, at a *very* chill pace
    i want to play both, at the same time, during the downtimes
    eg: ed exploring has a lot of downtime and boredom factor
        late game hm is boring, and once you stop mining npcs the community is so low it gets very boring

#how:
    players can hack each other, based on things in both games
    example:
    create edhm account, create user in hm called CMDR<name> so we can matchmake
    maybe if shields are down on ed, then the sys.loc is revealed to the attacker
    make a leaderboard system: EDcredits+HMgc, eg: 72kCR+1B357KGC = rank?
    ed stats from [inara](https://inara.cz/inara-api/), hackmud only has [chat api](https://www.hackmud.com/forums/general_discussion/chat_api_documentation)

#lore:
    COVAS is what is hacking and what gets hacked, silent war between ships    

#how2:
    scan for edhm users: (matchmaking)
    priority: cmdrs who recently visited the system where you currently are
